        <h1>SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
        <p>The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[11] It formed
            about
            4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary
            disc.
            The
            Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core,
            releasing
            this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.</p>
