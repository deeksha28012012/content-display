<h2>MERCURY</h2><br>
<p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient
Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified
as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p><br>
<h2>VENUS</h2><br>
<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It has a thick
atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in our solar
system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 900°F (475°C). Venus is similar in size to Earth,</p><br>
<h2>EARTH</h2><br>
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth
being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is
contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of
which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.</p><br>
<h2>MARS</h2><br>
<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
It is about half the size of Earth and has a thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars is
characterized by its rocky terrain, polar ice caps, and evidence of past water flow, suggesting it may have been more
Earth-like billions of years ago. It is also the only planet where rovers have been sent to explore its surface, making
it one of the most studied bodies in our solar system.</p><br>
<h2>JUPITER</h2><br>

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. It is more than twice as massive
as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water,
floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky
after the Moon and Venus. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p><br>
<h2>URANUS</h2><br>
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water,
ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's
atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all
the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14
minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous
sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.</p><br>
<h2>SATURN</h2><br>
<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant,
with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is
over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its
mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years</p><br>
<h2>NEPTUNE</h2><br>
<p>Neptune is an ice giant. It is similar to a gas giant and is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing
over a solid core about the size of Earth. Neptune has a thick, windy atmosphere. In Roman religion, Neptune is the god
of freshwater and the sea. He is the counterpart of the Greek god Poseidon. In the Greek-inspired tradition, he is a
brother of Jupiter and Pluto; the brothers preside over the realms of heaven, the earthly world (including the
underworld), and the seas.</p><br>
